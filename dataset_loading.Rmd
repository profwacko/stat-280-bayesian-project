# SETUP

## Loading Library

```{r}
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Loading Data

```{r}
happiness.df <- read_csv(file="datasets/world-happiness/happiness.csv")
colnames(happiness.df) <- make.names(colnames(happiness.df) %>%  tolower)
happiness.df <- happiness.df %>% select_if(is_double) %>% select(-c(x1,happiness.rank,dystopia.residual))
```

We can get the train-test split using createDataPartition from caret:

```{r}
happiness.df %>% head(5)
```

```{r}
set.seed(42)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(happiness.df$happiness.score, p = 0.9, list = FALSE)
happy.train <- happiness.df[ trainIndex,]
happy.test  <- happiness.df[-trainIndex,]
```
